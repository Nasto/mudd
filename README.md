## Name

The name of the repository references Star Trek's [Mudd androids](http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Mudd_androids).

> They were constructed by an unnamed humanoid species for the purpose of performing necessary service functions, freeing their makers to evolve a perfect social order.

The goal of the tools in this repository is just that. They aim to get rid of manual tasks as much as possible in different development scenarios.
